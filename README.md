# task_05

My name is Debneel Roy and this is day 5 of my SQL Developer Internship at Elevate Labs.

Today's task was to insert values into the tables and perform different join operations on the two tables

I have created two tables for today's task. Firstly, a Customers table which has the following columns:

1. CustomerID-Customer ID
2. CustomerName-Customer name
3. City

Secondly, an Orders table which has the following columns:

1. OrderID
2. OrderDate
3. CustomerID
4. Amount

The SQL script is given in the repository.

Thank You.
